# Paint-Program
A simple paint program made with Java.

This is a continuation of the Programming By Doing exercises I've been working on. 
Decided to try to make a paint program, especially since my Macbook doesn't have one natively. I'd like to redo the entire program so that its not all cluttered.

Would like to change the way the draw patterns are from circles to strokes like MS Paint, but that'll be another time.

Thanks,
Brandon Widow
